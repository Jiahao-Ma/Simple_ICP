# ICP Algorithm Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains a simple yet effective implementation of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, which is widely used in the field of computer vision and robotics for aligning 3D shapes. This project includes two primary methods of ICP:

1. **SVD-based ICP:** This method utilizes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for aligning point clouds.
2. **Non-linear Least Squares ICP:** An implementation that uses a non-linear least squares optimization technique.

## Features
- Efficient and accurate implementation of ICP algorithms.
- Visualization of the alignment process with GIF animations.
- Easy-to-understand code structure suitable for educational purposes or further development.
